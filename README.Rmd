## Overview

`dartR.spatial` aims to support analysis of SNP data in a spatial context. For example running a least-cost-path analysis or simple isolation by distance plots. There is also a function that calculates spatial autocorrelation.

dartR.spatial is one package of the dartRverse. 
Currently the dartRverse consists of the following packages:

-   dartR.base   (report, filter and input/output functions, basic popgen)
-   dartR.data   (repository for example data files)
-   dartR.sim     (functions to simulate SNP data)
-   dartR.spatial (spatial analysis <- this package)
-   dartR.popgen (popgen analysis)
-   dartR.sexlinked (under development)



`dartR` and its packages is a collaboration between the University of Canberra, CSIRO and
Diversity Arrays Technology, and is supported with funding from the ACT
Priority Investment Program, CSIRO and the University of Canberra.
